# goit-markup-hw-01

This repository contains the first assignment of my software development course. The task involves creating the basic structure of an HTML document.

## Overview

- **Objective**: Build the foundational skeleton of an HTML document.
- **Skills Practiced**: Understanding and applying HTML structure, including elements like `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.

## Structure

The project includes:
- A single HTML file.
- No CSS or JavaScript yet, as this assignment focuses solely on HTML.

## Future Improvements

Additional styling and interactivity will be added in future assignments as I progress in the course.
